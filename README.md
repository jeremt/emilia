# Work in progress ðŸ‘·

This is an attempt to get informations about a theater play. The idea is to get the repartition for each character. For now, there is just 2 hardcoded examples with 2 plays (epub files are not included sorry).

I might make something more generic with AI some day, or maybe not ðŸ˜…

## Run (for now)

```
cd src/lib
npx tsx script.ts
npx tsx script_2.ts
```

## There is also a visualizer to pratice dialogs

```
pnpm run dev
```
